## Installation

In order to install, after cloning this source, make sure you have all [dependencies](#dependencies) installed and setup. Then follow these steps in order:

```
$ cd $THIS_PROJECT
$ # install all server-side dependencies
$ npm install
$ # after finishing the server-side dependencies, take care of the client
$ cd public
$ # install client-side dependencies
$ npm install
$ # build client-side assets
$ npm run build
$ # after it's done, back to the server
$ cd ..
$ # start the server and that's it
$ node index.js
```

The `worker.js` needs to be triggered regularly (e.g. daily) in order to provide its functionality.

## Dependencies:
```
$ # Dependencies are managed using homebrew on macOS
$ brew info node
node: stable 7.0.0 (bottled), HEAD
$ brew info mongo
mongodb: stable 3.2.10 (bottled)
$ brew info redis
redis: stable 3.2.5 (bottled), HEAD
$ # Don't forget to npm install
```

## Development

There are some npm scripts to help you:
```
$ # Start a development server which reloads when *.js files change
$ npm run dev
$ # Start a long running, non-reloading server for production
$ npm start
$ # To get detailed debug output
$ DEBUG=bouquet:* npm run dev
```

If you want to work on the frontend (**important:** you have to build it at least once!):
```
$ cd public
$ # There are other dependencies for the frontend, ensure to install them as well
$ npm install
$ # Build and watch the vuejs app (with hot module replacement)
$ npm run dev
$ # ... or build the vuejs app once
$ npm run build
```
